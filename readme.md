## Check this out to get an idea what we will work with

[This short introduction in the official documentation](https://reactnative.dev/) gives a nice idea about what React Native is.

The easiest way to start with React Native is [expo](https://expo.io/features). Check [this answer](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/39170622/what-is-the-difference-between-expo-and-react-native) to get the idea about where the library lies in React Native ecosystem. 

Finally, to know see how React Native stands versus Native Development check [this post](https://medium.com/mop-developers/mobile-app-development-react-native-vs-native-ios-android-49c5c168045b)

## Applications built with React Native

There are plenty of companies using React Native as a tool of choice for their mobile applications. 
You can find famous examples [here](https://brainhub.eu/blog/react-native-apps/)
